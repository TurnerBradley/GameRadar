    <h4> Battlefield 2042's first season delayed to focus on addressing player criticism</h4>
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GB_3MK8gGs0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    <p> The new scoreboard, VOIP, and other additions, changes, and fixes are coming soon.</p>

    <p> Battlefield 2042 players have had a lot of gripes with the military FPS since it launched, and developer DICE has responded with balance tweaks, bug fixes, and the promise that it's listening. Here's the part where all that listening becomes listendoing: Battlefield 2042's first season has been pushed back from spring to early summer while the studio incorporates player feedback on the UI, squad dynamics, specialists, and the stuff coming in the upcoming season itself.</p>

  <p> In a blog post today, BF2042 senior producer Ryan McArthur said that DICE will use the extra few months to make "extensive fixes" and add new features. Three of those features, which are coming "as soon as possible," are voice chat, player profiles, and a redesigned scoreboard.</p>

 <p>The new scoreboard won't look exactly like the prototype we were shown recently, which some players criticized for not fully emulating the classic style. DICE plans to separate the teams into their own columns for the version releasing in the next update, and a later version will include death counts and an end-of-round report. It's going back to how it was in previous Battlefields, in other words. </p>
